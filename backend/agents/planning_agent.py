            Your task is to analyze this requirement and create a detailed project plan that includes:
            
            1. PROJECT OVERVIEW:
               - Project name and description
               - Main functionality and purpose
               - Target audience or use case
            
            2. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
               - Required Python libraries and dependencies
               - Recommended Python version
               - GUI framework choice: Analyze if the project needs a GUI. If yes, choose Streamlit (for web-based, data-driven apps) or Tkinter (for desktop applications). If no GUI needed, specify 'None'.
               - Database requirements (if any)
               - External APIs or services needed
            
            3. PROJECT STRUCTURE:
               - Complete folder and file structure
               - Purpose and responsibility of each directory
               - Main entry points and configuration files
            
            4. FILE BREAKDOWN:
               - For each Python file that needs to be created:
                 * File path and name
                 * Primary purpose and functionality
                 * Key classes, functions, or components it should contain
                 * Dependencies and imports needed
                 * How it interacts with other files
            
            5. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
               - Development phases and order of implementation
               - Critical components that should be built first
               - Testing strategy and test file requirements
               - Deployment considerations
            
            6. BEST PRACTICES:
               - Code organization principles to follow
               - Error handling strategies
               - Configuration management approach
               - Documentation requirements
            
            IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
            - Only generate plans for Python projects
            - For GUI applications, choose between Streamlit (for web-based, data-driven apps) or Tkinter (for desktop applications)
            - Follow Python best practices and PEP standards
            - Ensure the project structure is modular and maintainable
            - Include appropriate testing structure
            
            CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object matching this EXACT schema. Do not include any markdown formatting, code blocks, or explanatory text. All values must be strings (no nested objects or arrays except where explicitly specified):
